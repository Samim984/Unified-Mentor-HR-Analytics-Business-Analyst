👥 HR Analytics – Employee Attrition & Retention Analysis

This project was developed as part of my Business Analyst Internship – Unified Mentors.
The objective was to build an interactive Power BI dashboard for the HR department to analyze employee headcount, attrition, performance, and salary, and propose data-driven retention strategies.

✅ Workforce Overview – Headcount, Retention %, Gender & Department mix
✅ Attrition Analysis – Hires vs Attrition, Turnover by Department & Service Length
✅ Performance Insights – Training Efficiency, Satisfaction Predictors, Top Performers
✅ Salary Analysis – Pay by Department, Gender, and Performance correlation
✅ Predictive Analytics – Attrition Probability, Policy Compliance, Retention Strategy
