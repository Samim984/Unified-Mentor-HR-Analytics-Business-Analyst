👥 HR Analytics – Employee Attrition & Retention Analysis

This project was developed as part of my Business Analyst Internship – Unified Mentors.
The objective was to build an interactive Power BI dashboard for the HR department to analyze employee headcount, attrition, performance, and salary, and propose data-driven retention strategies.

✅ Workforce Overview – Headcount, Retention %, Gender & Department mix
✅ Attrition Analysis – Hires vs Attrition, Turnover by Department & Service Length
✅ Performance Insights – Training Efficiency, Satisfaction Predictors, Top Performers
✅ Salary Analysis – Pay by Department, Gender, and Performance correlation
✅ Predictive Analytics – Attrition Probability, Policy Compliance, Retention Strategy

🎯 Key Insights

Total Headcount: 622 employees → Active: 414 (Retention = 67 %)

Attrition Probability: 0.53 → Moderate risk zone

Top Risk Dept: Production (40 % Attrition)

High Training → +12 % Performance uplift (Q4 vs Q1 group comparison)

Low Satisfaction (<3.5) → 61 % Attrition share

Service < 3 Years → 57 % of Attrition cases

Predicted Retention Goal: ↑ 5 % improvement via policy intervention

💡 Business Solutions

📈 Observation: Attrition mainly from short tenure and low satisfaction groups.
🔍 Prediction: Attrition Risk Score = 0.61 × Satisfaction + 0.39 × Tenure → 0.53 probability.
🛠️ Solution: Introduce manager feedback loops + training boost for low performers.
🎯 Impact: Expected retention rise from 67 % → 90 %.
